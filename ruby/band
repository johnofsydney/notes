Guitartist looking to start Northern Soul / Motown band in Sydney

Hi, I'm John. I play electric guitar and I'm looking to start up a new band playing Northern Soul / Motown style of music.
I'll be looking for 
- female singers - lead and backing, ideally you're happy to do both and extra points if you can arrange the vocal parts
- drums
- bass
- brass

Looking rehearse weekly (at Zen in Sydneham) in the beginning and as time goes by swap some weeks rehearsals for gigs.

Playlist of suitable songs here - take a listen and get in touch if you like the sound of all this
